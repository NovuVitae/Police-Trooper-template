Hello, this is my first post in the forum and I wanted to share my work.

This are two files that contains 4 images in dds format, for this you will need to use OpenIV (https://openiv.com/)
If you wish to modify it ot just make another one, there's another file in which is the base canvas. in order to do this you will need to install a pluggin in the case you use photoshop like me. (https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-exporter) 
It's compatible with most of the vehicles that have as name the base file.

Installation:
- unzip the rar file
- export the .ytd files into OpenIV
- Go to editor mode
- Drag and drop
